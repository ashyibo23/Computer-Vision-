# Computer-Vision-
Low-Level Vision


This computer vision task provides the opportunity to design and implement a computer vision systems that can segment images. Your code needs to segment colour images into meaningful parts. In order to viusalize the quality of the segmentations, program output will be compared to ground-truth segmentations generated by human observers.

Traning images are provided in this repo also four binary images showing the boundaries between different regions of the image as identified by four different human observers. Notice that different human observers do not always agree on how to segment the same image. Hence, it is impossible to produce an algorithm that performs this task perfectly. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to find an algorithm that will work across different images (in other words, an algorithm, using specific parameter values, might work well for one image, but the same algorithm with the same parameters might produce very poor results on other images). Therefore, to accomplish this task it's good to implement a method that works reasonably well across a number of images, rather than try to produce perfect results on one or two images.

In order to get good result try to tune parameters.
